                    <ul>
                    <li>risk related to the Customer’s attributes;</li>
                    <li>risk associated with the channel for the supply of a product, service, transaction, or service delivery</li>
                    <li>risk related to the area (country and/or geographical).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Policy is prepared considering that the Company does not provide financial services and cash services. All of the Company’s services are provided electronically through a service platform (website) operated by the Company.</p>

                    <p>The Company shall notify the Financial Crime Investigation Service (hereinafter – “the FCIS”) in writing of the appointment or change of the employee (hereinafter – “the AML Officer”) responsible for implementation of prevention of ML/TF measures in the Company no later than 7 business days after their appointment or change.</p>
                    <p>This policy shall be accepted and approved by the resolution of the CEO and the AML Officer.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>II. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT</h3>
                    <p>The Company shall apply a risk-based approach when implementing measures to mitigate the risk of ML/TF.</p>
                    <p>The Company continually assesses and manages the ML/TF risks associated with the Company’s business relationship or incidental transactions. The Company’s risk assessment consists of:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Risk assessment at the Company level, which covers all activities of the Company, helps identify areas in which the Company has to implement priority risk management measures commensurate with the risks and the business specificities of the Company, the scope of its activities;</li>
                    <li>Risk assessment of relationships and transactions with customers and transaction validation, which includes identification, other KYC procedures and ongoing monitoring;</li>
                    <li>Continuous monitoring of the level of risk arising from the ongoing monitoring of customer transactions, monetary operations and status to match the Company’s customer profile and be not suspicious, ensuring that the information available to the Company is relevant, allowing an assessment of whether the level of risk has remained unchanged.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Comprehensive measures are applied by the Company to determine the risk of ML/TF both before and after establishing a business relationship with the customer, by analyzing the customer’s behavior and monetary operations, transactions carried out and information provided (documents) by him/her.</p>
                    <p>Customers of the Company are divided into following three risk groups:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Low-risk, customers who carry extremely low risk of ML/TF, including low risk to the Company’s reputation. Low risk group customers include all those who fulfil one or more of the low-risk attributes listed in Annex 1 of this Policy.</li>
                    <li>Medium-risk, customers rated as being at risk for some ML/TF by one or more attributes, but their status or operations carried out by them would not have the same impact on the Company’s reputation as high-risk customers or activities thereof. Medium-risk group customers include all those who do not fall under low or high risk customer categories as indicated in Annex 1 of this Policy.</li>
                    <li>High-risk, customers who have one or more of the attributes of increased risk of ML/TF and in respect of whom the Company has a reasonable suspicion that they may significantly adversely affect the Company’s reputation. Higher risk group customers include all those who meet one or more of the high-risk attributes listed in Annex 1 of this Policy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Customers are assigned to one of the identified risk groups when establishing business relationships. Subsequently, the risk profile of the customer may be changed in the light of the results of the monitoring of business relationships.</p>
                    <p>The customer risk assessment is built on the principle that higher risk is given a bigger risk score.</p>
                    <p>The establishment of the business relationship with high-risk customers must be approved by the AML Officer.</p>
                    <p>The customer risk assessment, both prior to establishing a business relationship and updating the customer’s data, is performed by employees responsible for the customer’s onboarding. Only after the customer’s risk assessment is completed, a decision is made on establishing a business relationship.</p>
                    <p>When assessing the risk of the customers, the primary aim is to evaluate all information available about the customers.</p>
                    <p>During assessment of customer's risk and establishment of business relationship the Company shall collect duly filled-in and executed Company's customers and/or ultimate beneficial owner questionnaire(-s) in accordance to section V of this policy. The Company's customers and ultimate beneficial owner questionnaire are presented in annexes of this Policy, accordingly Annex 2 and Annex 4.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>III. CUSTOMER’S TRANSACTIONS AND OPERATIONS MONITORING</h3>
                    <p>After establishing a relationship with the customer, the customer’s business relationships, including transaction and operations, are monitored on an ongoing basis- ongoing customer due diligence (ODD) is applied. This shall ensure that transactions and operations are consistent with the Company’s information of the Customer, its business, risk profile and source of funds. The Company maintains real–time and retrospective monitoring of business relationships and operations.</p>
                    <p>Employees of the Company (incl. the CEO and the AML Officer) must monitor customer’s transactions on an ongoing basis for any unusual operations or activities. Unusual features may be related to the size of the transaction, which is inconsistent with the customer’s financial position or past known business, the customer’s knowledge or experience, the unusual nature of the transaction as distinguished from other customer’s methods of operation or similar usual business practices, the complex structure of the transaction as compared to similar transactions in a similar profile of the customer or the market. ODD also means that the Company periodically updates of customer’s information.</p>
                    <p>In the event of any employee of the Company having any doubts about the legality, economic or legal validity of the customer’s activities or of any particular operation or transaction, its non-consistence with customer’s personal or business profile, sources of funds or financial capacity, the employee must immediately notify the AML Officer, who must then investigate further and determine decide on the necessity of reporting to the FCIS of the customer’s activity or transaction.</p>
                    <p>When monitoring the customer’s activities, transactions and operations, particular attention must be paid to:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>complex or unusually large transactions and any unusual transactional structures that have no apparent economic or visible legitimate purpose, and business relationships or operations with customers from third countries, where, in accordance with official information published by international intergovernmental organizations, measures to prevent ML/TF are insufficient or do not meet international standards.</li>
                    <li>any threat of ML/TF that may arise from the use of the services provided or the transactions carried out in order to conceal the identity of the Customer or the beneficial owner, as well as in respect of any business relationship or transaction with the customer who has not been identified through direct presence and, where necessary, immediate measures are taken to prevent the use of money for ML/TF.</li>
                    <li>whether the customer or a beneficial owner is included in the consolidated list of the United Nations of persons, groups and entities and bodies subject to EU financial sanctions.</li>
                    <li>whether the customer or the beneficial owner has no links with countries that are classified in the category of higher risk countries: they are subject to European Union sanctions or other restrictive measures, as well as to the countries identified by the Financial Action Task Force as high risk or non-cooperative countries.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Company has ongoing control over its operations for possible violations of international sanctions. Depending on the nature of the Company’s activities – provision of virtual currency services – the Company implements this obligation through a third-party monitoring tool.</p>
                    <p>The results and conclusions of unusual customer activities, transactions and operations investigations must be recorded in writing.</p>
                    <p>All communications to the FCIS are provided by the Company’s CEO or the AML Officer who is assigned to perform this function.</p>
                    <p>In case the Company has established a business relationship with the customer, determined as a high-risk customer, the Company applies enhanced ongoing customers due diligence (EODD). In addition to the measures applied for ODD, the Company shall monitor and analyze the following actions of high-risk customer:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Transaction types (e. g. series of high-value cryptocurrency transactions in a short period of time, instant withdraw of cryptocurrency deposits with no transaction activity);</li>
                    <li>Transaction patterns (e. g. frequent transfers of large amounts of crypto within a set period of time, to the same account from more than one person);</li>
                    <li>Anonymity (e. g. multiple cryptocurrency wallets controlled from the same IP address, IP associated with suspicious sources);</li>
                    <li>Senders and recipients (e. g. elderly or financially vulnerable customers engaging in high-volume cryptocurrency transactions);</li>
                    <li>Source of funds (e. g. transactions involving cryptocurrency accounts with known links to illegal activities, such as fraud, extortion, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If the employee (incl. the CEO and the AML Officer) becomes aware or otherwise suspects that a transaction, operation, or customer activity is suspicious, or for any other reason listed in this Policy would be reported to FCIS, he/she will promptly record it, re-examine, carry out further examination of the information available in order to assess whether there is a basis for providing such information to the FCIS and, where available, submit the information in the format, procedures and timelines set by the FCIS.</p>
                    <p>All employees of the Company, without exception, must be prohibited from informing the customer or any other person that information about the customer’s operations or transactions, or any other information, has been provided to the FCIS or other supervisory authority.</p>
                    <p>The Company or its employees are not liable to the customer for failure to perform their contractual obligations or for damage if this occurs as a result of suspending an operation or transaction and reporting the allegations to the FCIS or because of failure by the customer to provide data to confirm his identity, or providing incomplete or incorrect information, or if customer or his representative avoids providing the information necessary to identify him/her.</p>
                    <p>No liability must be imposed on Company’s CEO, the AML Officer or other employees who, in good faith, report information on suspected ML/TF or suspicious operations or transactions to the FCIS. Likewise, they may not be subject to any disciplinary action by the Company.</p>
                    <p>The Company must notify the FCIS immediately, no later than within 1 (one) business day after the occurrence of such information or suspicion, if the Company is aware or suspects that assets of any value are directly or indirectly derived from a criminal offence or by participating in a criminal offence.</p>
                    <p>Where it is determined that the customer carries out a suspicious operation or transaction, regardless of the amount of the operation or transaction, it is mandatory to suspend the operation or transaction (unless due to the nature of the operation or transaction, the manner in which it is performed or other circumstances it is objectively impossible) and no later than 3 business hours from the time of the transaction or the suspension of the monetary operation to report this operation or transaction to the FCIS. If, due to the nature of the operation or transaction, the manner in which they are performed, or other circumstances, the operation or transaction has not been suspended, the FCIS must be notified no later than 3 business hours after such operation or transaction is identified. Immediate reporting is also required when the Company employees receive information that the Customer intends or will attempt to execute a suspicious operation or transaction.</p>
                    <p>The Company is required to unilaterally suspend a suspicious operations/transaction and upon receipt of a written order from the FCIS must suspend any suspicious operation or transaction performed by the customer for a period of up to 10 business days from the time or circumstances specified in the order. During this period, the Company’s suspended transaction/operation may be renewed only with the permission of the FCIS.</p>
                    <p>If the Company is not obligated to execute the temporary restriction of the ownership rights within 10 business days after the notification or FCIS order has been received, the operation or transaction shall be resumed.</p>
                    <p>Notification of suspicious operations or suspicious transactions to the FCIS must be submitted by logging in to the FCIS information system and filling in the approved electronic form for the provision of information on suspicious operations or suspicious transactions.</p>
                    <p>Only in exceptional cases, should the Company not be able to access the FCIS information system and complete the information submission form, or would not be able to do so for other technical reasons, it may also, in emergency cases, submit the information to the FCIS by phone, fax or email.</p>
                    <p>The suspicious transaction report form must include:</p>

Upon termination of the business relationship, the Responsible employees must report such customer and other related information into the registration journal of customers with whom transactions or business relationships are terminated (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTmFQ8Y4IMnvYdj9b0tF3pS34lYEy2WM/edit#gid=232679309" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annex 5</a>) in accordance with the procedure set forth in this Policy.</p>

                    <p>If the customer has initiated updates in his account information, the changes must be evaluated, and risk should be reassessed accordingly.</p>
                    <p>If the changes in the customer’s information resulted in a change of the customer’s risk level, the date from which the customer’s data must be updated is renewed according to their risk level.</p>
                    <p>If the customer did not update his/her data when required according to his/her risk level during the period of 3 months, services provided by the Company to the customer will be limited.</p>

                    <p>During the review, it is always mandatory for customers to be screened for being included in the sanctions lists, changes in their status of politically exposed persons or existence of any negative information. If the functionality of the systems used by the Company allows, such verification must not be periodic, but is performed on a continuous basis through consolidated databases, whereby once entered, the customer's information is constantly verified and any changes in customer status are reported to the Company’s CEO who periodically reviews system alerts for potential new results related to changes in the customer status and takes appropriate action.</p>
                    <p>Evidence of the review is stored in the customer’s electronic file in the Company’s database.</p>
